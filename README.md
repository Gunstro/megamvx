# MegatonCities MVX - Project Master Plan

A comprehensive PWA platform for financial independence through structured commissions, geographic ownership, and community building.

## Overview
MVX (MegatonCities Virtual X-perience) empowers users to achieve Â£2,500/month income via a non-MLM matrix system, dual-currency economy, and geo-based revenue streams. Built as a React/Next.js PWA with real-world integrations like Bluetooth MDPs and virtual billboards.

## Core Components
- **VISA System**: Tiered membership with matrix positions and income caps.
- **Currencies**: AF (stable) and MB (growth) with punitive exchange mechanics.
- **Partner Program**: Geographic ownership for additional commissions.
- **Technical Stack**: React/Next.js + TypeScript + TailwindCSS PWA.
