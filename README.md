# megamvx
Core design and documentation hub for the MegatonCities MVX PWA platform.
We refer to the patform as the "MAST-Technology Platform". "In the MegatonMVX system, we use the MAST framework. Think of it as the mast of a yacht. 
It's the central pillar that everything else is built upon. It supports the sails of our being and our stories/journey allowing us to harness the winds of creativity, and gives us the stability to navigate the vast and often chaotic seas of the multiverse. Without a strong mast, the ship goes nowhere. With MAST, we can journey anywhere."

# MegatonCities MVX - Project Master Plan

A comprehensive PWA platform for financial independence through structured commissions, geographic ownership, and community building.

## Overview
MVX (MegatonCities Virtual X-perience) empowers users to achieve Â£2,500/month income via a non-MLM matrix system, dual-currency economy, and geo-based revenue streams. Built as a React/Next.js PWA with real-world integrations like Bluetooth MDPs and virtual billboards.

## Core Components
- **VISA System**: Tiered membership with matrix positions and income caps.
- **Currencies**: AF (stable) and MB (growth) with punitive exchange mechanics.
- **Partner Program**: Geographic ownership for additional commissions.
- **Technical Stack**: React/Next.js + TypeScript + TailwindCSS PWA.

## Documentation Structure
- [Overview](./docs/01-overview.md) - Project vision and high-level architecture.
- [VISA System](./docs/02-visa-system.md) - Membership tiers, matrix, and commissions.
- [Currencies](./docs/03-currencies.md) - AF and MB mechanics.
- [Partner Program](./docs/04-partner-program.md) - Geographic ownership model.
- [Technical Stack](./docs/05-technical-stack.md) - Implementation details.
- [Mapping System] (./docs/06-mapping-system.md) - All about the MegaMAPS.

## Getting Started
1. Review docs above for system understanding.
2. Set up local development: `npm install` in the `src/` folder (future).
3. Use GitHub Issues for decisions and tracking.

## Roadmap
- Phase 1: Core VISA selection and dashboard.
- Phase 2: Partner Program integration.
- Phase 3: Plugin modules (social, mall, ads).
